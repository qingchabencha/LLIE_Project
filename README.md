# üåô CVAE-Guided Color Restoration for Low-Light Image Enhancement

Welcome to our project on **low-light image enhancement (LLIE)** with **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** guidance!  
We focus on improving color restoration in extremely dark regions where traditional enhancement models fail due to the absence of reliable lighting cues.
