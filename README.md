# üåô CVAE-Guided Color Restoration for Low-Light Image Enhancement

Welcome to our project on **low-light image enhancement (LLIE)** with **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** guidance!
We focus on improving color restoration in extremely dark regions where traditional enhancement models fail due to the absence of reliable lighting cues.

# Dataset

Unzip and put dataset [LOL-V2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zoBcUq5o0VmuXHd-9w1wgTby4183Yd-x?usp=drive_link) and [LOL-V1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/157bjO1_cFuSd0HWDUuAmcHRJDVyWpOxB/view) under the LLIE_Project folder if you want to try out the model.

# Training 

run the following code to train the model, the configuration file is in `./Options`. 

```python
python main.py --model_option ./Options/RetinexFormer_custom.yml --train_save_dir CUSTOM_SAVE_DIR
```

# Pretrained Result

There are already four model being trained and stored in `./train_results`
- `./train_results/reinexformer_baseline` & `./train_results/reinexVAE` are trained on multiple different dataset.
- `./train_results/reinexformer_baseline_onlyLOLV2` & `./train_results/reinexVAE_onlyLOLV2` are trained only on LOLV2 Normal dataset.
